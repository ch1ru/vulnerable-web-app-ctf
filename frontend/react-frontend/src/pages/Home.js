            <h2>The Enuma Elish</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>

                The Enuma Elish which are the first two words of the epic{'\n'}
                and mean simply “When on high” is the creation myth of{'\n'}
                ancient Mesopotamia. This is the Babylonian version of a{'\n'}
                much older Sumerian myth and originally the chief figure{'\n'}
                of the myth was Enlil, the Sumerian storm god. When{'\n'}
                Babylon conquered the rest of Mesopotamia and{'\n'}
                established the Old Babylonian Empire around 1800 BCE,{'\n'}
                it became necessary to explain how the local god of{'\n'}
                Babylon, Marduk, had now become supreme among the{'\n'}
                gods. Therefore, the older Sumerian myth of creation was{'\n'}
                retold and Marduk was substituted for Enlil.{'\n'}

                When on high the heaven had not been named,{'\n'}
                Firm ground below had not been called by name,{'\n'}
                Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,{'\n'}
                and Mummu2 Tiamat, she who bore them all,{'\n'}
                Their waters commingling as a single body,{'\n'}
                No reed but had been matted, no marsh land had appeared,{'\n'}
                When no gods whatever had been brought into being,{'\n'}
                Un-named, their destinies yet undermined—{'\n'}
                Then it was that the gods were emerged from within them.{'\n'}
                Lahmu and Lahamu were came forth, were called by name,{'\n'}
                Before they had grown in age and statue.{'\n'}
                Anshar and Kishar were shaped, more mighty than the{'\n'}
                others.{'\n'}
                They extended the days, added on the years.{'\n'}
                Anu was their heir, rival of his father;{'\n'}
                Verily, Anu, Anshar's first-born, was his equal.{'\n'}
                Anu sired his image Nudimmud.{'\n'}
                This Nudimmud was the master of his father,{'\n'}
                Of broad wisdom, understanding, mighty in strength,{'\n'}
                Mightier by far than his grandfather, Anshar.{'\n'}
                He had no rival among the gods, his brothers.{'\n'}
                The divine brothers6 banded together,{'\n'}
                They disturbed Tiamat as they rushed here and there,{'\n'}
                Indeed, they distraught and tormented Tiamat{'\n'}
                By their boisterous mirth in the dwelling of Heaven.{'\n'}
                Apsu could not diminish their clamor{'\n'}
                And Tiamat was dumbfounded at their ways.{'\n'}
                Their doings were loathsome to him.{'\n'}
                Offensive and overbearing were their ways.{'\n'}
                Then Apsu, the begetter of great gods,{'\n'}
                Cried out, addressing Mummu, his vizier:{'\n'}
                “0 Mummu, my vizier, who rejoices my spirit,{'\n'}
                Come hither and let us go to Tiamat!”{'\n'}
                They went and sat down before Tiamat,{'\n'}
                Exchanging counsel about the gods, their offspring.{'\n'}
                Apsu, opening his mouth,{'\n'}
                Said unto radiant Tiamat:{'\n'}
                “Their ways are truly abominable unto me.{'\n'}
                By day I find no relief, nor repose by night.{'\n'}
                I will destroy, I will wreck their ways,{'\n'}
                That quite may be restored. Let us have rest!”{'\n'}
                As soon as Tiamat heard this,{'\n'}
                She was troubled and called out to her husband.{'\n'}
                She cried out, as she raged all alone,{'\n'}
                Injecting woe into her mood:{'\n'}
                “What? Should we destroy that which we have produced?{'\n'}
                Their ways indeed are most troublesome, but let us practice{'\n'}
                kindness!”{'\n'}
                Then answered Mummu, giving counsel to Apsu;{'\n'}
                Rude and ungracious was Mummu's advice{'\n'}
                “Destroy, my father, their rebellious ways.{'\n'}
                Then shall you have relief by day and rest by night!”{'\n'}
                When Apsu heard this, his face grew luminous{'\n'}
                Because of the evil he planned against his godly sons.{'\n'}
                He embraced Mummu by the neck{'\n'}
                As he sat down on his knees to kiss him.{'\n'}
                Now whatever they had plotted between them,{'\n'}
                Was repeated unto the gods, their first-born.{'\n'}
                When the gods heard this, they were astonished,{'\n'}
                Then lapsed into silence and remained speechless.{'\n'}
                Superior in wisdom, accomplished and resourceful,{'\n'}
                Ea, the all-wise, saw through their design.{'\n'}
                Made artful his spell against it, surpassing and holy.{'\n'}
                He recited it and made it subsist in the deep,{'\n'}
                As he poured sleep upon him. Sound asleep he lay.{'\n'}
                When he had made Apsu lie prone, deep in sleep,{'\n'}
                Mummu, the advisor, was powerless to stir.{'\n'}
                He7 loosened Apsu's band, tore off his tiara,{'\n'}
                Removed his halo and put it on himself.{'\n'}
                Having constrained Apsu, he slew him.{'\n'}
                Mummu he bound and locked.{'\n'}
                Having thus upon Apsu established his ascendance,{'\n'}
                He laid hold of Mummu, holding him by the nose-rope.{'\n'}
                After Ea had vanquished and tramped down his foes,{'\n'}
                Had assured his triumph over his enemies,{'\n'}
                In profound peace he rested in his sacred chamber,{'\n'}
                He named it “Apsu,” for shrines he assigned it.{'\n'}
                He founded his cult in that same place.{'\n'}
                Ea and Damkina, his wife, dwelled there in splendor.{'\n'}
                In the chamber of fates, the house of destinies,{'\n'}
                A god was engendered, most able and wisest of gods.{'\n'}
                In the heart of holy Apsu was Marduk created.{'\n'}
                He who begot him was Ea, his father.{'\n'}
                ________________________{'\n'}

                Now Tiamat renewed the conflict and created an army{'\n'}
                ofmonsters. This time even the great Ea could not withstand{'\n'}
                the attack and the gods decided to ask the young Marduk to{'\n'}
                defend them against Tiamat.{'\n'}
